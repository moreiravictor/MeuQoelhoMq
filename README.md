## How to install dependencies


## Python

To setup your virtual env firstly run:

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Node

Install Node 20. We recommend to do using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), but you can also use [the official](https://nodejs.org/en) website if you like.


After install run `node -v` command to check if everything worked well. It should return something like `v20.X.X`

## Generate protocol files and install dependencies

Run:
```
./setup.sh
```

## Server

To run server:

```
python3 ./server/src/server.py
```

## Clients

To tryout test stub, open another terminal tab and run:

### Python
```
python3 ./server/src/stub.py
```
### Node
```
node ./client-node/index.js
```
